# Product-List
Main focus on CSS and Bootstrap ,Jquery
First i have downloaded and installed vs code and github from chrome.
Create a folder in your desktop and open it on vs code. install bootstrap 4 from extensions.
I have used html5 for product page catalog and add required source link like bootstrap cdn and font-awesome.css in head tag.
Script files in above the body end tag.
Used css3 animations and transitions, shadow, fade in effects for rich user experience.
finally pushed all files from vs code to github using vs code comman palatte.
